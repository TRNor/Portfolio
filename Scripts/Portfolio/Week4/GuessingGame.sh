# GuessingGame.sh - A script that uses the getNumber() function in a number guessing game with the following rules:
    # The user should be asked to enter a number between 1 and 100.
    # If the number is 42, the game should print 'Correct!'.
    # If the number is less than 42, the game should print 'Too Low!'
    # If the number is greater than 42, the game should print 'Too High!'
    # The game should repeat until the user has found the correct number
