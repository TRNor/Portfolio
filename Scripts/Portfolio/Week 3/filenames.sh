mapfile -t lineArray < filenames.txt

# Purpose: For each line (array element) compare to various conditions using if/else statement and file operators. (Ref 3)

for i in ${lineArray[@]};
do

    if [ -f $i ]; then
        echo "$i - That file exists"
    elif [[ -d $i ]]; then
        echo "$i - That's a directory"
    elif [ -z $i ]; then
        :
    else
        echo "$i - I don't know what that is."
