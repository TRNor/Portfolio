    # This program looks at an existing password hash stored in a text file (secret.txt) and compares it with a user's entered password.
    # If the user enters the correct password, the program prints "Access Granted" to screen and has an exit code 0.
    # If the user enters an incorrect password, the program prints "Access Denied" to screen and has an exit code 1.
    # The code contains commented out tests for each stage of code for development and debugging purposes.
    # The correct password is "myPassword"
